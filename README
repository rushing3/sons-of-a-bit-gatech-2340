MORDOR TRAIL


INSTALLATION

1. clone the repository (you can also download a copy of the source from the top right
   of the page)
   
2. create the folders C:\2340 and C:\2340\mordor. These folders will host the database 
   and template HTML files.
   
3. Make sure that python 2.7 and Django 1.3 are both installed (preferably add them
   to your system path). 
   
4. copy the contens of the "res" folder (should be html files) to your C:\2340\mordor 
   folder
   
5. navigate in console to the folder where "manage.py" is found and execute (no quotes):
    a. "python manage.py syncdb"
    b. "python manage.py runserver"
    
6. navigate in a browser to http://localhost:8000/

7. Don't die of dysentery.


NEW!!!
EXTRA FILES

I added an "extra" folder in our repository root. This folder will contain sample
CSS and HTML files so that a working server is not required in order to build css.


NEW!!!
UPDATED FOLDER STRUCTURE
there's no need for the stupid directory hierachy that eclipse decided on. Now,
everything is in the root folder.

NEW!!!
NOT WORKING FOR WINDOWS!
